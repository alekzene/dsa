Given n number of arrays with variable lengths and containing positive and negative integers find and print the shortest range using one element from each array and store all the numbers in a sub-array. If the numbers in the sub-array contains a prime number then merge all the arrays together efficiently and sorted. After find using the numbers in the sub-array find and print the first and last occurrence in the sorted array, and all possible sub-arrays whose values equal 0. If the sub-array does not contain any prime numbers then find and print the first and last occurrence of every number array; if the number cannot be found in the array then print "Cannot be found".

Example 1:

[ 3, 6, 8, 10, 15 ]
[ 1, 5, 12 ]
[ 4, 8, 15, 16 ]
[ 2, 6 ]

The shortest range is 4-6: [4, 5, 6]

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 10, 12, 15, 15, 16]

 

The first occurrence of 4 is index 3.

The last occurrence of 4 is index 3.

 

The first occurrence of 5 is index 4.

The last occurrence of 5 is index 4.

 

The first occurrence of 6 is index 5.

The last occurrence of 6 is index 6.

 

No possible sub-arrays can be made whose sum is 0

 

Example 2;

[-1, 3, -4, 9]

[-5, 6, 1, 3, 8, 8]

 

The shortest range is 8-9: [8, 9]

 

8 Cannot be found.

 

The first occurrence of 9 is index 3.

The last occurrence of 9 is index 3.

 

The first occurrence of 8 is index 4.

The last occurrence of 8 is index 5.

 

9 Cannot be found.
